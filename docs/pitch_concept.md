# 7ewesbiya: The Pitch Concept

**Target Audience:** The Jury / General Public
**Presenter:** The "Girl" (Pitcher)
**Core Theme:** "Don't just visit. *Feel*."

---

## 1. The Hook (The "Why")
*Start with a question or a relatable pain point.*

"We all love visiting historical sites, right? But what usually happens? You stand in front of a magnificent 300-year-old gate, you look at it for 5 seconds, maybe take a selfie... and then you walk away. You missed the story. You missed the soul of the place. Traditional audio guides are clunky, and reading Wikipedia on your phone kills the immersion."

## 2. The Solution (The "What")
*Introduce 7ewesbiya not as an app, but as a companion.*

"Meet **7ewesbiya**. It’s not just a guide; it’s a time-traveling companion that lives in your pocket. But here is the magic: **It is completely hands-free.**"

## 3. The MVP "Magic" (The Demo)
*Explain exactly what the MVP does. This is what she needs to sell.*

"In our MVP, we focus on one seamless experience: **Context-Aware Storytelling**."

*   **No Buttons:** "I don't have to search for 'Main Gate'. I don't have to scan a QR code."
*   **Just Walk:** "I simply walk. The app knows where I am using Geolocation."
*   **It Speaks:** "As soon as I approach the monument, the AI whispers the story into my ear. It feels like a local friend walking right beside me."

## 4. The Pitch Script (Draft)

> "Imagine you are walking through the Medina. You put your phone in your pocket and put your headphones on.
>
> You turn a corner and see an ancient fountain. Suddenly, a voice begins: *'This fountain has quenched the thirst of travelers for three centuries...'*
>
> You didn't press play. You didn't touch your screen. You just *arrived*.
>
> This is 7ewesbiya. We use real-time geolocation to trigger immersive AI audio stories instantly. We bridge the gap between the physical stone and the digital story, without the screen getting in the way.
>
> For this MVP, we have built the core engine: The Location-to-Audio pipeline. You walk, we detect, we tell the story. Simple. Magical."

## 5. Future Vision (To answer "What's next?")
"While today we guide you, tomorrow we will listen. Our next phase introduces the 'Ask Anything' feature, where you can interrupt the guide and ask, 'Who built this?' and get an instant answer. But for today, we start with the most important part: The Story."
